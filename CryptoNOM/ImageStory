Name:
Soulless Necromancer

Description:
The soulless necromancer is a powerful wizard who lost his soul attempting to steal the golden ankh of dark light.
It is known to all that this ankh amplifies the powers and abilities of a necromancer, as entire armies of undead can be revived with this single treasure. Unable to use his own powers to resuscitate his soul, the undead wizard must find the ankh once again to release the spell that doomed him to an eternity of death and despair. In his undead form, the soulless necromancer can destroy all objects of white light with his hand of death.
